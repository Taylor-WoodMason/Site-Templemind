            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Hey, I'm Mason, an 18-year-old who's been passionate about fitness for 2.5 years. I know how tough it is to get started, especially as a teen. That's why I created Temple Mind. I want to help you develop both a strong mind and body, pushing you to reach your full potential. Fitness isn't just about looking good—it's about feeling good and gaining confidence in yourself. Together, we'll unlock your true strength.</p>
