            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Hey, I’m Mason,  an 18-year-old with 2.5 years of fitness experience, and I’m here to help you build a stronger body and mind. I know how hard it can be to start when you're young, and that’s exactly why I created Temple Mind—to help others like me who want to get fit and stay healthy. I want to show you that it’s not just about lifting weights—it’s about lifting your confidence, too.</p>
