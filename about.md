Hey, I’m Mason, the 18-year-old behind Temple Mind. I started lifting at 15, and over the past 2.5 years, I’ve learned a ton about building muscle, staying consistent, and pushing through plateaus. This site is my way of sharing what’s worked for me—and what hasn’t.

My Journey
I wasn’t always into fitness. I started lifting because I wanted to feel stronger and more confident. At first, it was just about getting bigger, but over time, I realized it was about more than that. It’s about building discipline, learning patience, and understanding how my body responds to training and nutrition.

What I’ve Learned
Consistency is Key: It’s not about lifting the heaviest weights or following the latest trends. It’s about showing up, putting in the work, and trusting the process.
Recovery Matters: Sleep, nutrition, and rest days are just as important as the workouts themselves. Your muscles grow when you rest, not when you train.
Form Over Ego: Lifting heavy is great, but lifting correctly is better. Proper form prevents injuries and ensures you're targeting the right muscles.
Nutrition is Fuel: You can’t out-train a bad diet. Eating enough protein and balanced meals supports muscle growth and recovery.
Why Temple Mind?
I created Temple Mind to share my journey and help others who are starting out or looking to level up their training. Whether you’re a beginner or someone who’s been lifting for a while, I hope you find something here that helps you on your path.

Thanks for checking out Temple Mind. Let’s grow stronger together.
